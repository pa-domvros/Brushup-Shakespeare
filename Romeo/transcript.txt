But, soft!
0:03
What light through yonder the window breaks?
0:08
It is the east and Juliet is the sun.
0:15
Arise, fair sun,
0:18
and kill the envious moon, who is already sick and pale with grief
0:22
that thou her maid art far more fair than she.
0:27
Be not her maid, since she is envious.
0:31
Her vestal livery is but sick and green and none  but fools do wear it
0:36
Cast it off.
0:38
Hey.
0:39
It is my lady,
0:40
Ooh!
0:41
[audience laughing]
0:43
It is my love!
0:45
O, that she knew she were!
0:49
She speaks  
0:50
yet she says nothing. What of that?
0:54
Her eye discourses.
0:56
I will answer it.
0:57
[audience laughter]
1:00
I am too bold.
1:01
[audience laughter]
1:03
'Tis not to me speaks.
1:08
Two of the fairest stars in all the  heaven, having some business,
1:12
do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1:15
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1:20
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars.
1:23
See, how she leans a cheek upon her hand!
1:28
That I were a glove upon that hand that  I might touch that cheek! I me
1:31
- Ay me.
1:32
- She speaks! Ooh!
1:34
[audience laughter]
1:36
Speak again, bright angel, for thou art as  glorious to this night being o'er my head
1:42
as is a winged messenger of heaven
1:46
until the white-upturned, wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1:50
when he bestrides  the lazy-puffing clouds
1:53
and sails upon the bosom of the air.  
1:55
- O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou  Romeo?
2:00
Deny thy father and refuse thy name,  
2:02
or, if thou wilt not,
2:04
be but sworn my love, and I'll no  longer be a Capulet.
2:06
- Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
2:08
- 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
2:11
[audience laughter]
2:12
What's Montague?
2:14
It is nor hand, nor foot, nor arm, nor face, nor
2:18
any other part belonging to  a man.
2:21
[audience laughter]
2:21
O, be some other name!
2:25
What's in a name?
2:27
That which we call a rose by any other word  would smell as sweet.
2:30
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
2:33
retain that dear perfection  which he owes without that title.
2:38
Romeo,
2:40
doff thy name and for thy name, which is no part  of thee, take all myself.
2:45
- I take the thee at thy word.
2:46
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized. Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
