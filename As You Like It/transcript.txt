Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy.
0:07
This wide and universal theatre  
0:10
presents more woeful pageants than the  scene wherein we play in.  
0:14
All the world's a stage,
0:18
and all the men and women merely  players.
0:24
They have their exits and their entrances,
0:28
and one man in his time plays many parts.
0:31
His acts being seven ages. 
0:33
At first the infant, mewling, and puking in the  nurse's arms.
0:39
And then,
0:41
the whining school-boy, [laughter] with his satchel and shining morning face, 
0:43
[Laughter]
0:45
with his satchel and shining morning face, 
0:50
creeping like snail unwillingly to school.
0:56
And then the lover,
0:57
sighing like furnace, with a  woeful ballad made to his mistress' eyebrow.  
1:03
Then a soldier,
1:05
full of strange oaths, and bearded like  the pard.
1:08
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation
1:13
even in the cannon's mouth.
1:15
And then, the justice,
1:18
in fair round belly with good capon lined, with eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
1:24
full of wise saws, and modern instances.
1:29
And so he plays his part.
1:33
The sixth age, shifts into the  
1:35
lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
1:38
with spectacles on nose and pouch on side, his youthful hose  
1:43
well saved a world too wide for his shrunk shanks.
1:49
And his big manly voice turning again  
1:53
towards childish treble, pipes and whistles in his sound.
1:59
Last scene of all, that ends this  
2:04
strange, eventful history,
2:08
is second childishness, and mere oblivion.
2:13
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste.
