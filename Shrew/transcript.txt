Thy husband is thy lord.
0:05
Thy life, thy keeper, thy head, thy sovereign,
0:09
one that cares for thee, and for thy maintenance commits his body
0:16
to painful labour both by sea and land,
0:21
to watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
0:25
while thou liest warm at home, secure and safe.
0:34
And craves no other tribute at thy hands but love, fair looks and true obedience.
0:45
Too little payment for so great a debt.
0:48
Such duty as the subject owes the prince Even such a woman owes to her husband.
0:58
And while she is forward, peevish, sullen,
1:02
sour and not obedient to his honest will, what is she?
1:06
What is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord?
1:14
I am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war when they should kneel for peace.
1:28
To seek for rule, supremacy and sway, when they are bound to serve, love and obey.
1:40
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth, unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
1:51
But that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts?
2:00
Come, come, you froward and unable worm.
2:10
My mind hath been as big as one of yours, my heart as great, my reason haply more,
2:16
To bandy word for word and frown for frown.
2:20
But now I see our lances are but straws, our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
2:32
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
2:41
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot, and place your hands below your husband's foot:
2:53
In token of which duty, if he please, my hand is ready; may it do him ease.
